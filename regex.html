    <b>Python</b> is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. 
    <insert>Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.</insert>
    <delete>Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.</delete><br>
    <b><i><u>It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.<br>
    It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</u></i></b><br><br>
    Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. <br>
    Python v<sub>2.0</sub> was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. <br>
    Python v<sup>3.0</sup>, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[36]
    Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.<br><br>

    Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable.<br> 
    It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.<br>
    Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain.
