    <b>Python</b> is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. 
    <insert>Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.</insert>
    <delete>Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.</delete>
    <b><i><u>It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
    It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</u></i></b>
    Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. 
    Python v<sub>2.0</sub> was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. 
    Python v<sup>3.0</sup>, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[36]
    Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.

    Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses 
    English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
    Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in
    Web Development Domain.
